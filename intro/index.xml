Using our scanning tool, you you find the risks in your code and dig deeper into the information provided.
Once you have signed up, you can immediately start scanning repositories and commits for vulnerabilities.
If you are ready to improve your code&amp;rsquo;s security, please read below to get started for free.</description></item><item><title>Key workflows</title><link>https://docs.blubracket.com/intro/key-workflows/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 02:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.blubracket.com/intro/key-workflows/</guid><description>BluBracket code security tools are optimized to prevent risks from getting into code, and to promote the process of continuous improvement that reduces existing risks from code over time.
Preventing risks in code # As developers, we depend on a quick feedback loop to understand if our code is working and does what is expected. BluBracket tools can offer automated security guidance as part of that feedback loop, in the IDE of your choice, pre-commit, and as part of the CI flow.</description></item><item><title>Integrations</title><link>https://docs.blubracket.com/intro/integrations/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 02:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.blubracket.com/intro/integrations/</guid><description>Local workflow tools # The BluBracket CLI tool can identify and block secrets before they&amp;rsquo;re committed.
