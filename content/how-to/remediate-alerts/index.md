There are a number of best practices when it comes to handling secrets in code.  Below are a few:

* Encrypt your secrets

* Use environmental variables

* Use a secret manager to store your secrets, like HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, etc.

Once BluBracket has found a secret and you have had a chance to remediate the secret in code, marking it as reviewed will help you easily differentiate it from those that still require action.
