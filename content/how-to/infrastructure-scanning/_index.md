By default the Infrastructure as Code feature is not configured for repositories on new tenants.  This is mainly because it requires a few key steps within the git repository before BluBracket can properly scan and monitor for these types of vulnerabilities.  Also, the steps involved in the configuration are slightly different for each git repository type.  If you are interested in configuring Infrastructure as Code for the repositories you are monitoring, select the appropriate git repository provider below and weâ€™ll walk you through it.
