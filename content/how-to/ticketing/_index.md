Automatic ticketing of detected issues gives security and developer teams visibility into security issues in the tools they're using to plan, track, and report work. No need to sign into or use another too.

Out of the box, BluBracket supports Jira and ServiceNow, and additional integrations are possible via the flexible APIs.
