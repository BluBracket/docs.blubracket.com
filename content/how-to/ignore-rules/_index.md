Configuring rules for ignoring detected risks can be set at multiple levels:

- [Per repo]({{< relref "/how-to/ignore-rules/per-repo" >}}), with configuration files in the repo
- [Globally]({{< relref "/how-to/ignore-rules/global" >}}), for all users and repos in an account, with a configuration file in the account
