#### Creating a GitHub personal access token

* In order for BluBracket to access information within a given repository, an access token must be uploaded into the tenant.  

* If you want to use a PAT to access resources owned by an organization that uses SAML SSO, you must authorize the PAT. For more information, see ["About authentication with SAML single sign-on"](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/about-authentication-with-saml-single-sign-on) and ["Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on"](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on) in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

* In the BluBracket settings page when selecting GitHub Cloud you will be presented with the option to generate a GitHub token with appropriate scopes.  You must be signed into the GitHub account that you wish to use with BluBracket for this function to work. This option is only available for GitHub Cloud.

* In the upper-right corner of any page, click your profile photo, then click **Settings**.

* To use your token to authenticate to an organization that uses SAML single sign-on, authorize the token. For more information, see ["Authorizing a personal access token for use with SAML single sign-on"](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-cloud@latest/authentication/authenticating-with-saml-single-sign-on/authorizing-a-personal-access-token-for-use-with-saml-single-sign-on) in the GitHub Enterprise Cloud documentation.

#### Entering your personal access token

* After generating your personal access token, it needs to be entered into BluBracket. In the BluBracket portal go **Settings**, and then click **Add Code Server**.

![Add Code Server button](add-code-server.png)

* On the **Add Code Server** page select GitHub Cloud
