### How BluBracket works

BluBracket has two parallel modes of operation:

1. As a SaaS suite providing protection and alerts across a codebase, supporting the detection, analysis, and remediation of security risks in the code and related to code access
1. As a local CLI tool scanning code locally, to support immediate identification of potential risks in the code, without the risk of sending that code to remote servers

And BluBracket integrates at multiple points in the SDLC workflow:

- Before code is committed, via the CLI and pre-commit hooks
- Before code is merged, via CI checks (GitHub Checks, Bitbucket Code Insights, Jenkins, etc.)
- Actionable alerts in Slack and other tools when new risks are detected
- Tools to analyze and understand existing risks, and trend reports to see improvement over time
