### How BluBracket works

BluBracket has two parallel modes of operation:

1. As a SaaS suite providing protection and alerts across a codebase, supporting the [detection, analysis, and remediation of security risks in the code]({{< relref "key-workflows/#understanding-and-taking-action-on-existing-risks" >}}) and related to [code access]({{< relref "key-workflows/#auditing-git-access--configuration" >}})
1. As a [local CLI tool scanning code locally]({{< relref "key-workflows/#pre-commit-hooks" >}}), to support immediate identification of potential risks in the code, without the risk of sending that code to remote servers

And BluBracket integrates at multiple points in the SDLC workflow:

- [Before code is committed]({{< relref "key-workflows/#pre-commit-hooks" >}}), via the CLI and pre-commit hooks, and in popular IDEs
- [Before code is merged]({{< relref "key-workflows/#ci-checks" >}}), via CI checks (GitHub Checks, Bitbucket Code Insights, Jenkins, etc.)
- [Actionable alerts]({{< relref "key-workflows/#alerts" >}}) in Slack and other tools when new risks are detected
- [Tools to analyze and understand existing risks]({{< relref "key-workflows/#pre-commit-hooks" >}}), and trend reports to see improvement over time
