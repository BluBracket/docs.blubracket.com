## Adding your first code server

{{< youtube Ex-JA_xkZ0M >}}

Go to Settings â†’ Code Servers in the BluBracket web console to add repos from your GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or another supported code server.

Full details about [how to add a code server are available in the usage guide](https://docs.blubracket.com/how-to/add-code-servers/).

## Improve your code security with every commit

1. Add BluBracket to your workflow with [GitHub Checks](https://docs.blubracket.com/intro/key-workflows/#ci-checks) or the [CLI tool](https://docs.blubracket.com/intro/key-workflows/#preventing-risks-in-code) so you can identify risks before your next commit.
2. Review [existing risks](https://docs.blubracket.com/intro/key-workflows/#understanding-and-taking-action-on-existing-risks) to understand your overall code health and make a plan for what is urgent and what can wait.
3. Track your security health improvements with every commit.
