## Adding your first code server

Go to Settings > Code Servers in the BluBracket web console to add one or more code repositories hosted on GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, or another supported code server.

Full details about [how to add a code server are available in the usage guide](https://docs.blubracket.com/how-to/add-code-servers/).

## Improve your code security with every commit

1. Add BluBracket to your workflow with the CLI tool, [GitHub Checks (or other CI checks)](https://github.com/BluBracket/docs.blubracket.com) so you can identify risks before your next commit.
2. Review [existing risks](https://docs.blubracket.com/intro/key-workflows/#understanding-and-taking-action-on-existing-risks) to understand your overall code health and make a plan for what is urgent and what can wait.
3. Track your security health improvements with every commit.
