BluBracket can monitor any repositories on a supported code server that you have access to. Fully supported code servers include cloud and enterprise versions of:

- GitHub
- GitLab
- Bitbucket

Support for additional code servers is in development, and may be available in private beta.

On GitHub, for example, you can monitor repos in your personal GitHub org as well as company/group orgs where you have permission to add apps.
