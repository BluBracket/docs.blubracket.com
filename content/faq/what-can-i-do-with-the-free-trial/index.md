BluBracket Community Edition has all the features of the [BluBracket Team Edition](https://blubracket.com/pricing/), including:

- Risk detection for [secrets](/intro/use-cases/#secrets), [PII](/intro/use-cases/#pii), [non-inclusive language](/intro/use-cases/#inclusive-language), and [infrastructure-as-code](/intro/use-cases/#iac), and other risks in code
- [Workflow support](/intro/key-workflows/) from pre-commit through historical risk remediation

Those tools can help you:

- Understand your overall code health and see the areas of highest risk
- Implement workflows to stop new risks from getting into code
- Monitor your code health and watch it improve with every commit

[These docs walk through the sign-up process](/intro/getting-started/).
