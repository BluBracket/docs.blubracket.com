The free trial has all the features of the [BluBracket Teams Edition](https://blubracket.com/pricing/), including:

- Risk detection for [secrets](/intro/use-cases/#secrets), [PII](/intro/use-cases/#pii), [non-inclusive language](/intro/use-cases/#inclusive-language), and [infrastructure-as-code](/intro/use-cases/#iac), as well as [git access and configuration](/intro/use-cases/#access-auditing)
- [Workflow support](/intro/key-workflows/) from pre-commit through historical risk remediation

Those tools can help you:

- Understand your overall code health and see the areas of highest risk
- Implement workflows to stop new risks from getting into code
- Monitor your code health and watch it improve with every commit
