Yes. BluBracket can identify hundreds of different types of secrets in code, including tokens, keys, IDs and passwords, but the BluBracket CLI tool also supports user-defined regular expressions to match and alert on.

For more detailed information on how to add regular expressions to the CLI, [look here](/how-to/cli/using-cli/#own-secrets).
