Yes. BluBracket can identify hundreds of different types of secrets in code, including tokens, keys, IDs and passwords, but the BluBracket CLI tool also supports user-defined regular expressions to match and alert on.

For more detailed information on how to add regular expressions to the CLI, [look here](https://support.blubracket.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057401752-Adding-regular-expressions-to-the-BluBracket-CLI-Tool-search-).
