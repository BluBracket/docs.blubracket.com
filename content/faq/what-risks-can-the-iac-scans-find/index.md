#### OpenAPI

- OpenAPI securityDefinitions is not defined or is empty
- If the security scheme is not of type 'oauth2', the array value must be empty
- Security scheme allows cleartext credentials over unencrypted channels
- Security object needs to have defined rules in its array and rules should be defined in the securityScheme
- Security object for operations, if defined, must define a security scheme, otherwise it should be considered an error
- Security requirement not defined in the security definitions

### Implementation

BluBracket's IaC scanning is [powered by the open source Checkov library](/faq/how-does-blubracket-iac-scanning-compare-to-checkov/), and adds BluBracket workflow and reporting.
