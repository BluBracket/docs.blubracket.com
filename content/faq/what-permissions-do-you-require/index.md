When you authenticate into BluBracket using GitHub Oauth you will see and approve the following permissions:

- Read access to administration, code, members, metadata, organization administration, and pull requests
- Read and write access to checks, organization hooks, and repository hooks

These permissions allow BluBracket to monitor the repositories that you select and present you with any secrets found as well as contributor/commit information.
