Yes. With the BluBracket Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, you can catch secrets before the code is committed to a repository. Once downloaded and configured, the tool will report any risks found in commits and optionally block commits until they're addressed.

The BluBracket CLI tool works with pre-commit hooks, and with any IDEs where the pre-commit hooks are supported.
