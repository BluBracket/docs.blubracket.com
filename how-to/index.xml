Below are a few:
Encrypt your secrets
Use environmental variables
Use a secret manager to store your secrets, like HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, etc.
Once BluBracket has found a secret and you have had a chance to remediate the secret in code, marking it as reviewed will help you easily differentiate it from those that still require action.</description></item></channel></rss>
