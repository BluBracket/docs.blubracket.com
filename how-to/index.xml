This article covers configuring the BluBracket app in Azure AD, configuring the Azure AD SAML federation in BluBracket, and managing users.
Once single sign-on is configured as described below, authentication, passwords, and two-factor authentication are managed and configured in Azure AD.
However, users must be registered in both BluBracket and Azure AD. Removing a user from either Azure or BluBracket will terminate their access to BluBracket.</description></item><item><title>Remediate alerts</title><link>https://docs.blubracket.com/how-to/remediate-alerts/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 02:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.blubracket.com/how-to/remediate-alerts/</guid><description>There are a number of best practices when it comes to handling secrets in code. Below are a few:
Encrypt your secrets
Use environmental variables
Use a secret manager to store your secrets, like HashiCorp Vault, Azure Key Vault, etc.
Once BluBracket has found a secret and you have had a chance to remediate the secret in code, marking it as reviewed will help you easily differentiate it from those that still require action.</description></item><item><title>Integration architecture</title><link>https://docs.blubracket.com/how-to/architecture/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jan 2022 02:48:57 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://docs.blubracket.com/how-to/architecture/</guid><description>BluBracket runs as SaaS, on-prem, or in your VPC, and integrates with a variety of cloud-hosted or on-prem tools to secure your entire code pipeline from developer to deploy.
